# Demo Skills

Just a demo of some stuff I'm capable of doing.

## Cache
Caching using Google Guava to simulate going to a 
"service" and caching the results. Later I'll use
Redis as the cache. Right now it's just reading from
resource file for data, holding it in memory. When
access via a cache, it loads from the service if 
not in cache and places in cache.

## API
A web REST API

## Discovery
A discovery client to find services this thing needs

## The Thing
The thing being implemented
